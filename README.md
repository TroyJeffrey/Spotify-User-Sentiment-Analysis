# Spotify User Sentiment Analysis: Tracking App Sentiments Over Time

In this data science endeavor, I conducted a comprehensive sentiment analysis of user reviews for the Spotify music streaming application, aiming to uncover valuable insights into user sentiments over time. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, I collected, processed, and analyzed a vast dataset of user-generated reviews from the Google Play Store.

Through sentiment analysis, I categorized user sentiments into positive, negative, or neutral, allowing me to track sentiment trends and fluctuations with each app version update. Additionally, I integrated user ratings to further understand the correlation between user satisfaction and sentiment expressions.

This project provided critical data-driven insights into user perceptions of the Spotify app, enabling the identification of areas for improvement and enhancement. Moreover, it demonstrated my proficiency in NLP, data analysis, and the ability to derive actionable insights from user-generated content.

The project's findings contribute to enhancing user experiences, guiding product updates, and fostering data-informed decision-making within the music streaming industry.
